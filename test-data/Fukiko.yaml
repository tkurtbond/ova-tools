  background: |
    All little children dream of being like their most cherished
    heroes. Fukiko was no different. Every day (except when there was
    schoolwork or chores to be done), she would throw herself into the
    fantastic imaginary worlds of her shoujo manga. Fighting evil!
    Making friends! And maybe catching the attention of a handsome
    male comrade. But that’s all they were: imaginary two-dimensional
    illustrations trapped forever in the pages of her comic books.

    But sometimes, dreams come true.  One night while gazing at the
    stars out- side her window, as she loved to do, Fukiko was shocked
    to encounter a strange cat.  Not just any cat, but a white cat
    with pink feathery wings. Though finding a creature like this on
    her window sill was more than a little unusual, Fukiko’s cu-
    riosity overcame her apprehension. She opened the window. The
    feline’s peculiar avian nature was only the beginning of a slew of
    strange surprises. The cat spoke to her, revealing himself to be
    Azyrus. As if this weren’t enough, Azyrus continued to explain
    that Fukiko’s mother, who died when she was too young to remember,
    was a magical crime fighter. The stories were so remarkably
    similar to her manga that Fukiko could hardly believe her ears.
    Despite being overwhelmed, she listened attentively to Azyrus as
    he continued his explanations. Her locket, a keepsake from her
    mother, was also the key to her mother’s power. Though Azyrus, as
    well as Fukiko’s mother, had hoped this power would never be
    needed again, that would not be the case. And so the young heroine
    Lovely Savior Myu Myu was born. But the story had just begun…
  appearance:
  personality: |
    Fukiko is strong-willed and naive, expect- ing the world to play
    by her definition of the rules. This blind faith is also her
    strength, giving her the ability to see the good in bad and to
    persevere against all odds. Even so, her childish nature can lead
    to a bit of whining from time to time.
  notes:

      text: |
        Whenever Fukiko clutches her locket and shouts “Lovely Savior
        Transformation,” she becomes her kitty cat crime-fighting
        form. Her locket transforms into a collar with a bell, and the
        rest of her attire changes into her pretty little Myu Myu
        costume.  Of course, even villians will wait through the
        lengthy transformation sequence before continuing any battle.
        Must be the catchy music and the flashing lights.  She can
        also use this power to just change her apppearance, but she
        cannot use Shape-Shifter and Transformation simultaneously.

        Despite his cute a fuzzy exterior, Azyrus is always ready
        with sage advice for Fukiko.  He can often be exasperated
        with her youthful naivete, but his heart is in the right
        place—even when his mouth isn't.
